Here you will find the files that were presented in the workshop.

To view the Jupyter notebooks as slides, as seen in the workshop, you must install the Reveal.js - Jupyter/IPython Slideshow Extension, also known as [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE#installation). Using conda this is done by
```
conda install -c damianavila82 rise
```
